Use cases

This part is the equivalent of the Model in MVC.
It accepts a list of defined parameters and executes action OR gives data.
It doesnt read anything except the methods parameters.
The query parameter processing is done outside.

A request returns:
- one datatable
- one datable with lots of filters applied
- an HTML page containing 3 datatables + other values
- 2 datatable being from different websites, different dates, different filters applied
- the results of 3 other requests with the same parameters
