FEATURES
========
- TRANSLATIONS
	- All strings in the application
	- JS strings to be translated
	- Generic exception system
- when a method is called and doesn't make any access check, 
  we can throw a NoticeException and display the message 
  in debug mode in the API returned value in the field "notice" or "debug"
- in the piwik.php process, we could do without all the information in the cookie except for the idvisitor
  we could select the information last_action_time, last_id_action, etc. assuming we have the idvisitor in the cookie
  this would allow to save the logs later by big bulk
- Purge log_ when archiving is done
- Provide Config file feature for plugins (works as the translation system)
- CHANGE setColumnsToDisplay TO setColumnsIdsToDisplay

BUGS
====
- hide the generator + phpdocumentor script from being triggered by the release
- monthly unique visitors count is WRONG
- create the tmp directory + subdir automatically
- the referer URLs with host registered as main_url or alias_url should NOT be counted as referer
- the token md5 generation doesn't check that the md5 generated is unique, 
  but it should (the field is unique in the database)
- if elements from the config file are deleted, bug without any notice or warning
  system for config file default values?
- if the path necessary sometimes in the configuration do not have a / when they should
  it could break the system...
	/*
	 * Make sure the compare directory has a trailing slash so that /tmp doesn't
	 * accidentally match /tmpfoo
	 */
	if ($element{strlen($element)-1} != $slash) {
	$element .= $slash;
	}
- is_numeric is not valid. Replace by is_int OR is_float

User Interface
==============
- searching on countries should search on the final label and not the iso code

TODO MISC
=========
- check that ajax called made once per request
- when the plugins are not used in the piwik.php logging script, don't load the related files
- Archive::build() must have the same parameters order as all the API calls that use idSite, Period, Date
- change all .png images to GIF
- Ensure that all parameters to the API are checked against security rules etc.
- check that the yesterday/today etc. feature doesnt cause any bug in the process 
  (like when checking if 2007-09-02 which is yesterday has been archived when piwik thinks 'yesterday' has been archived...)

CHANGES DONE TO LIBRARIES
=========================
- edited zend_log and changed attr to protected
- fixed bug fwrite in zend_log stream writer
- fixed PEAR so that it works under PHP5 with STRICT MODE enabled

COMMENT
=======
When commenting
- check warning PHP DOC for missing @package
- look for "[TAB]function " for missing public/private on methods
