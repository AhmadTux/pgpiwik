FEATURES
========
- when a method is called and doesn't make any access check, we can throw a NoticeException
  and display the message in debug mode in the API returned value in the field "notice" or "debug"

BUGS
====
- the token md5 generation doesn't check that the md5 generated is unique, 
  but it should (the field is unique in the database)
