FEATURES
========
- when a method is called and doesn't make any access check, we can throw a NoticeException
  and display the message in debug mode in the API returned value in the field "notice" or "debug"
- in the piwik.php process, we could do without all the information in the cookie except for the idvisitor
  we could select the information last_action_time, last_id_action, etc. assuming we have the idvisitor in the cookie
  this would allow to save the logs later by big bulk
  
BUGS
====
- the token md5 generation doesn't check that the md5 generated is unique, 
  but it should (the field is unique in the database)
- if elements from the config file are deleted, bug without any notice or warning
  system for config file default values?
- if the path necessary sometimes in the configuration do not have a / when they should
  it could break the system...
	/*
	 * Make sure the compare directory has a trailing slash so that /tmp doesn't
	 * accidentally match /tmpfoo
	 */
	if ($element{strlen($element)-1} != $slash) {
	$element .= $slash;
	}
