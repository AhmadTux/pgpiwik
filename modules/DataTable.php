/**
 * ---- DataTable
 * A DataTable is a data structure used to store complex tables of data.
 * 
 * A DataTable is composed of multiple DataTable_Row.
 * A DataTable can be applied one or several DataTable_Filter.
 * A DataTable can be given to a DataTable_Exporter that would export the data under a given format (XML, HTML, etc.).
 * 
 * A DataTable has the following features:
 * - serializable to be stored in the DB
 * - loadable from the serialized version
 * - efficient way of loading data from an external source (from a PHP array structure)
 * - very simple interface to get data from the table
 * 
 * ---- DataTable_Row
 * A DataTableRow in the table is defined by
 * - multiple column (a label, multiple values, ...)
 * - details
 * - [a sub DataTable associated to this row]
 * 
 * Simple row example:
 * - columns = array(   'label' => 'Firefox', 
 * 						'visitors' => 155, 
 * 						'pages' => 214, 
 * 						'bounce_rate' => 67)
 * - details = array('logo' => '/img/browsers/FF.png')
 * - no sub DataTable
 * 
 * A more complex example would be a DataTable_Row that is associated to a sub DataTable.
 * For example, for the row of the search engine Google, 
 * we want to get the list of keywords associated, with their statistics.
 * - columns = array(   'label' => 'Google',
 * 						'visits' => 1550, 
 * 						'visits_length' => 514214, 
 * 						'returning_visits' => 77)
 * - details = array(	'logo' => '/img/search/google.png', 
 * 						'url' => 'http://google.com')
 * - DataTable = DataTable containing several DataTable_Row containing the keywords information for this search engine
 * 			Example of one DataTable_Row
 * 			- the keyword columns specific to this search engine = 
 * 					array(  'label' => 'Piwik', // the keyword 
 * 							'visitors' => 155,  // Piwik has been searched on Google by 155 visitors
 * 							'pages' => 214 // Visitors coming from Google with the kwd Piwik have seen 214 pages
 * 					)
 * 			- the keyword details = array() // nothing here, but we could imagining storing the URL of the search in Google for example
 * 			- no subTable
 *  
 * 
 * ---- DataTable_Filter
 * A DataTable_Filter is a applied to a DataTable and so 
 * can filter information in the multiple DataTable_Row.
 * 
 * For example a DataTable_Filter can:
 * - remove rows from the table, 
 * 		for example the rows' labels that do not match a given searched pattern
 * 		for example the rows' values that are less than a given percentage (low population)
 * - return a subset of the DataTable 
 * 		for example a function that apply a limit: $offset, $limit
 * - add / remove columns
 * 		for example adding a column that gives the percentage of a given value
 * - add some details
 * 		for example the 'logo' path if the filter detects the logo
 * - edit the value, the label
 * - change the rows order
 * 		for example if we want to sort by Label alphabetical order, or by any column value
 * 
 * When several DataTable_Filter are to be applied to a DataTable they are applied sequentially.
 * A DataTable_Filter is assigned a priority. 
 * For example, filters that 
 * 	- sort rows should be applied with the highest priority
 * 	- remove rows should be applied with a high priority as they prune the data and improve performance.
 * 	
 * 
 * 
 * ---- Other
 * We can also imagine building a DataTable_Compare which would take 2 DataTable that have the same
 * structure and would compare them, by computing the percentages of differences, etc.
 * 
 * For example 
 * DataTable1 = [ keyword1, 1550 visits]
 * 				[ keyword2, 154 visits ]
 * DataTable2 = [ keyword1, 1004 visits ]
 * 				[ keyword3, 659 visits ]
 * DataTable_Compare = result of comparison of table1 with table2
 * 						[ keyword1, +154% ]
 * 						[ keyword2, +1000% ]
 * 						[ keyword3, -430% ]
 *
